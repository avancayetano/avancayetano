# About me
Hi, I am Anthony Van Cayetano, currently a BS Computer Science student. I like coding in my free time and creating whatever random projects I find to be interesting. I am currently interested in Web development, 3D game development, and Data science. 



[See my past projects here](https://github.com/avancayetano?tab=repositories) or my [portfolio website](https://avancayetano.github.io/).

## This one is my favorite: 

- **CLIngine.** A game engine for developing command line interface (CLI) ASCII art games. This uses the Python curses library. Check this project [here](https://github.com/avancayetano/clingine).
